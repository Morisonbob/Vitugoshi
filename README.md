A <b>VERY</b> personal project.           
                 
Vitugoshi is a <b><i>Tamagotchi</i> like mobile game</b> where you have to take care of the main character like a <b>virtual pet.</b>

You have to take care of the character's <b>health, happiness, and energy.</b>

You have the options to <b>change his clothes and the background</b>, you can give the character <b>food, affection and put him to sleep.</b> You can also <b>cycle through the character lines.</b>

<b>#Talking Design#</b>
           
I made this game as a gift to my girlfriend on our <b>5 years together birthday.</b> She likes this kind of game and I wanted to give her a meaningful gift.
The game uses a lot of lists to store its data like clothes, background, and lines in a way that it can be more <b>easily changed in the Unity inspector</b> without messing with the code.

The game uses the <b>Unity built-in mobile notifications</b> to send some alerts to the player (not anything related to the game, just some messages that I wanted my girlfriend to be reminded of).

Most of the art I got from the internet and did some edits. However, there's <b>some original art</b> that I made when I saw fit like the pet cockatiel that hangs with the character (Her name is Carol, Carol a calopsita).

It's a <b>very very personal project</b>, but I wanted to share and talk a thing or two about it.
